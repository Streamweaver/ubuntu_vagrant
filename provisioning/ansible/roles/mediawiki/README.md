This role never got to the point of working well. I decided to abandon MediaWiki because it's more heavyweight than any of my use cases and the manual install was needlessly complicated given it's problems working with the current version of PHP at the time I was working at the wonkiness of getting compose to work through Ansible.

I'm leaveing this directory for future reference bit it is not used.
